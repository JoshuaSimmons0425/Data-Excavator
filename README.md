A No-Code Data Mining App designed for classification ML algorithms. Things to include: 

  - Core logic: create the core CRISP-DM functionality of end-to-end data integration to ML modelling and deployment.
  - Custom deployment: create a module or script to automate the containerisation of a complete model onto a fully functioning web app to interact with (probably through a Docker image with a Flask\FastAPI front-end script).
  - System Design diagram: to properly outline the framework of the project and use it as a reference of future improvements.

(this is still work in progress hehe)
